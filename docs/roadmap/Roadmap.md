## Roadmap

Currently, our product only supports cache with Redis.
We intend to change this also add support for the following caching solutions:

- In-Memory cache
- MemCached
- Couchbase

Regarding the caching itself, we now only support cache for non-controller methods. In the near future we intend to add support to cache in controllers.
